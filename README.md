# Mathematics
Latex files, PDFs, and presentations on specific mathematical theories and ideas. The papers were written in Latex, a mathematical
formatting program that allows you to code and compile aesthetically pleasing math papers. A bulk of the work was done by hand, solving
formulas and proofs, and converying this info in an understanding and teachable format. Further work was done to create and deliver 
presentations on said papers to a room of students and faculty. These projects gave me a love for teaching others difficult and 
unapproachable math concepts in an enjoyable and exciting format. These also showcase a small glimpse of the mathematical fields studied
in my collegic career.
